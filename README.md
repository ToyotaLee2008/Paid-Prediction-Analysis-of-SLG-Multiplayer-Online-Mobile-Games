# Paid-Prediction-Analysis-of-SLG-Multiplayer-Online-Mobile-Games

This project is a paid prediction for user behavior data of the SLG mobile game "Brutal Age". The case data comes from the 2nd Smart China Cup (ICC) of DC Competition. "Barbaric Age" is a popular SLG type mobile game around the world. According to App Annie's statistics, "Barbarian Age" has reached the No. 1 best-selling game in 12 countries and the top 10 best-selling games in 82 countries. Accurately understanding the value of each player is of great significance to the game's advertising strategy and efficient operation activities (such as accurate promotions and gift package recommendations), which helps to bring players a more personalized experience. Therefore, we want to be able to accurately estimate the value of players early in the game. **In this contest, we will use the player's behavioral data in the first 7 days of the game to predict the total amount paid by each of them within 45 days**
